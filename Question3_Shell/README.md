##### The unix scripting question is

* This question is to test your aptitude for writing small shell scripts on Unix. You are given this URL https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt. Write a shell script that extracts the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields only and saves them in a tsv file. And ever wondered if this data should not be stored in JSON?

1. The output will be in scheme.tsv and the script is in scheme_extract.sh.

2. The data we are dealing are in simple table form, so we shouldn't storing the data in JSON fomrat as JSON is used for hierarchical data format and it would ineffecient to parse JSON when  compare to CSV/TSV formats.
